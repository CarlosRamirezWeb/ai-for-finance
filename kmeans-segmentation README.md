# 📊 Customer Segmentation with K-Means

This project demonstrates the application of the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their income and spending score. The dataset used is the well-known "Mall Customers" dataset, which provides demographic and behavioral attributes.

## 🧠 Objective

To identify customer groups with similar purchasing behavior and income profiles, which can be used to improve marketing strategies, customer retention, and business decision-making.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset `Mall_Customers.csv` includes:
- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1–100)

## 🔧 Techniques Used

- Data visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters
- K-Means clustering with `sklearn`
- Cluster labeling and interpretation

## 📈 Results

We identified 5 distinct customer segments, ranging from:
- High spenders with low income
- Low spenders with high income
- Balanced behavior
- Cost-conscious customers

The visual clusters help interpret business insights from customer behavior.
